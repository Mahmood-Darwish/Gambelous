# Frontend

Unlike the Solidity section. This readme file needs to be fleshed out. It is one of the tasks on the TODO list.

## Development Setup

<a name="dev"></a>

### Development

To start development on the smart contract just clone the repo then run:

```
cd "frontend"
yarn
```

It will install all the dependencies and you can start development.

<a name="deploy"></a>

### Deployment

To run the frontend you can use the following command:

```
yarn dev
```

It will start the website at `localhost:3000`. You can use the website to interact with the contract deployed on Goerli.

The UI is very minimal and intuitive.
